# ML Resources

A place where I put all good resources with ML and with their code for training.

## Basis

- [Understand TensorFlow by mimicking its API from scratch](https://d3lm.medium.com/understand-tensorflow-by-mimicking-its-api-from-scratch-faa55787170d)

## Papers

- [MobileNets: Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for Mobile Vision Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04861.pdf)

## Theory

- [Depth-wise Convolution and Depth-wise Separable Convolution](https://medium.com/@zurister/depth-wise-convolution-and-depth-wise-separable-convolution-37346565d4ec)
- [Convolutional Variational Autoencoder](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/cvae)
